# rtmprelay

This is a dead-simple program for reading from one RTMP
URL, and writing to another.

It requires librtmp and skalibs.

## Building

Copy `config.mak.example` to `config.mak` and define your needed
`CFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS`, and so on.


## Usage

`rtmprelay src dest`

For example:

`rtmprelay rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/video_1 rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/video_2`

will read an RTMP stream from `/live/video_1` and send it to `/live/video_2`
